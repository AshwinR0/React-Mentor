   <h1>React Visual Tutor ⚛️</h1>
   <p><strong>An interactive, visual-first learning app for React — lessons, labs, and render instrumentation to build mental models.</strong></p>
</div>

---

## 🚀 Quick overview

- **Purpose:** Teach React concepts through interactive lessons and visual labs that demonstrate rendering, hooks, state, and performance patterns.
- **Tech stack:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind (CDN)
- **Highlights:** `RenderFlash` and `KeyRenderTracker` components for visual render tracking, multiple lesson modules in `modules/`, and a responsive sidebar for navigation.

---

## 🧭 Getting started

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (recommended 18+)

Install and run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# open the Vite URL (usually http://localhost:5173)
```

Build & preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## 📁 Project structure (important files)

- `index.html` — entry HTML and Tailwind CDN
- `index.tsx` — React entry / root
- `App.tsx` — main layout, lesson routing
- `types.ts` — `LessonId` enum and `Lesson` interface
- `components/` — UI and instrumentation components
   - `RenderFlash.tsx` — flashes visual cue + render counts
   - `KeyRenderTracker.tsx` — render counts for keyed instances
   - `Sidebar.tsx`, `Header.tsx` — layout/navigation
- `modules/` — each lesson is a self-contained page (e.g., `IntroLesson.tsx`, `JSXBasics.tsx`, `ReRendering.tsx`)

---

## ✨ Key features

- Interactive lessons with explainer UI and examples
- Visual render tracking (counts + flash) to build intuition about React's render behavior
- Hands-on labs for memoization, useCallback, batching, and render bailouts
- Clean, TypeScript-first codebase designed for teaching and extension

## ➕ How to add a new lesson

1. Create `modules/NewLesson.tsx` and export a React component.
2. Add a new `LessonId` in `types.ts` (e.g., `NEW_LESSON = 'new-lesson'`).
3. Import the module into `App.tsx` and add it to the `renderActiveLesson` switch.
4. Add a navigation entry in `components/Sidebar.tsx` to make the lesson discoverable.
5. Reuse `RenderFlash` and `KeyRenderTracker` when you want to show render behavior.

## 🛠 Development notes & suggestions

- Tailwind is included via CDN for simplicity; consider installing Tailwind locally for production builds and purging unused CSS.
- There are no tests configured yet — consider adding Vitest for component/unit tests (start with `RenderFlash` and `KeyRenderTracker`).
- Consider adding a simple CI workflow (GitHub Actions) to run build and tests.

## 📜 License

No license file is currently included. Add a `LICENSE` (e.g., MIT) if you want to open-source this project.

If you'd like, I can also add a CONTRIBUTING.md, a basic test setup with Vitest, or a GitHub Actions workflow — tell me which you'd like next and I’ll implement it.
